Guild war service for MMORPG KIT

## Configs
- Copy `.env.example`
- Rename copied file to `.env`
- Open `.env` and changes configs

## Database Connection Configs
Guild war database's provider is MySQL, so you have to prepare MySQL server, also have to create empty database which will be filled with tables later, then set connection string config `DATABASE_URL`, you can see info about connection string from [this link](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/mysql).
- `DATABASE_URL` is connection string to connect to guild war database.

## Guild War Database Creation
After you set `DATABASE_URL` properly, then you have to push tables by uses command `npx prisma db push --schema "./prisma/guildWarSchema.prisma"`

## Build and Start

npm run build
npm run start

## Want to use SQLite?
Try change schema.prisma -> datasource db to use SQLite, learn about it [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/sqlite)
